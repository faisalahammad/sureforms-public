/**
 * Sanitizer policy for entry content that legitimately contains markup —
 * rich-text textarea values and Pro change-log messages shown in the entries
 * admin view.
 *
 * DOMPurify's DEFAULT allowlist is deliberately broad — verified against 3.3.3,
 * it permits `style`, `form`, `input`, `button`, the media elements and the
 * SVG/MathML namespaces. That is wrong for this screen for three reasons:
 *
 *  1. None of that is script execution, but an unauthenticated form submitter
 *     could still land document-wide CSS or a cross-origin `<form action>` in
 *     wp-admin (UI redressing, defacement, click-jacked POSTs). An ATTACKER
 *     payload reaches this sink with no server-side filtering at all: submitted
 *     as entity-encoded text it contains no literal `<`, so PHP treats it as
 *     inert text and every kses pass leaves it alone — then
 *     decodeHTMLEntities() turns it back into live markup on the client, just
 *     before this call. DOMPurify is the ONLY guard standing here.
 *  2. Dropping the SVG/MathML namespaces removes `<foreignObject>` — the exact
 *     namespace CVE-2026-18406 used — and with it the `<svg><style>` shape,
 *     which is the one construct able to slip past DOMPurify's own anti-mXSS
 *     guard (that guard only fires on elements with no element children).
 *  3. The media elements are a zero-click outbound request from the reviewing
 *     admin's session — see the comment on FORBID_TAGS below.
 *
 * Note the asymmetry with LEGITIMATE rich text, which travels a different route:
 * it arrives as real markup and is filtered by Helper::sanitize_textarea(). That
 * function does NOT strip style attributes — disable_style_attr_parsing() returns
 * an empty allowlist, and WordPress's safecss_filter_attr() early-returns the CSS
 * unchanged when the allowlist is empty (kses.php), a behaviour pinned by
 * tests/unit/inc/test-helper.php. Stored rich text therefore legitimately carries
 * `style="color:…"`, `text-align` and `direction`, so `style` must be filtered
 * per-property here rather than forbidden outright.

 * style-based too, and `Helper::sanitize_textarea()` preserves them —
 * `disable_style_attr_parsing()` returns an empty allowlist, which makes

 * de-colour and un-align every rich-text entry already in the database.
 *
 * INVARIANT — only add a property here whose value grammar cannot reference a
 * `<url>` or an `<image>`. These four accept only `<color>` values and keywords,
 * which is what makes the value blocklist unnecessary. Adding `background`,
 * `background-image`, `list-style`, `content`, `border-image`, `cursor`, `mask`
 * or `filter` would turn this into a live external-fetch vector.
 *
 * That invariant is enforced by the USER AGENT's CSS value parser, not by this
 * file: a value the parser rejects never enters the CSSOM, so it cannot be
 * re-emitted. Verified in Chrome 150 — all four properties reject `url(…)`.
 * jsdom's `cssstyle` does NOT implement value validation for `text-align` or
 * `direction` and will happily store `text-align: url(…)`, so the unit tests
 * below pin PROPERTY filtering only. Widening this list is therefore a change
 * the test suite cannot catch; review it by hand.
